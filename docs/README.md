This folder contains comprehensive learning notes and summaries for the LangGraph Academy modules.

## üìö Summaries

### [1: Introduction to LangGraph](./1-intro-to-langgraph.md)
- Basic graph construction
- LLM integration and tool calling
- Routing and conditional edges
- ReAct agent pattern

- Deployment basics

### [2: State and Memory](./2-state-and-memory.md)
- State schema options (TypedDict, Dataclass, Pydantic)
- Reducers for parallel execution
- Multiple schemas pattern
- Message management strategies
- Intelligent summarization
- External memory systems

### 3: Human-in-the-Loop *(Coming Soon)*
- Breakpoints and interruptions
- Dynamic breakpoints
- State editing with human feedback
- Streaming with interruption
- Time travel

### 4: Parallelization *(Coming Soon)*
- Map-reduce patterns
- Parallel node execution
- Subgraphs
- Research assistant implementation

### 5: Memory Systems *(Coming Soon)*
- Memory stores
- Memory schemas
- Collections and profiles
- Advanced memory patterns

### 6: Deployment *(Coming Soon)*
- Production deployment
- Scaling strategies
- Monitoring and observability

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **[Quick Reference](./quick-reference.md)** - Common patterns and code snippets
2. **[Updates and Naming Schema](./updates-and-naming-schema.md)** - Documentation standards

## üìñ How to Use These Summaries

Each module summary follows a consistent structure:
- **Core Concepts**: Key ideas with progression
- **Essential Patterns**: Code examples you can use
- **Python Patterns**: Important Python concepts
- **Common Pitfalls**: What to avoid and why
- **Key Takeaways**: Main insights with practical applications

### Learning Path
1. Start with Module 1 for foundations
2. Master state management in Module 2
3. Add human interaction in Module 3
4. Scale with parallelization in Module 4
5. Implement advanced memory in Module 5
6. Deploy to production with Module 6

## üîß Contributing

When adding new summaries:
1. Follow the naming pattern: `{number}-{descriptive-name}.md`
2. Use the what-why-how format for explanations
3. Include practical code examples
4. Cover common pitfalls
5. Add to this README

## üìù Notes

- These summaries complement the Jupyter notebooks in each module
- Focus on conceptual understanding and practical patterns
- Code examples are simplified for clarity
- Always check the latest LangGraph documentation for updates
